- [google-research/morphnet](https://github.com/google-research/morph-net):  MorphNet is a method for learning deep network structure during training. The key principle is continuous relaxation of the network-structure learning problem. Specifically, activation sparsity is induced by adding regularizers that target the consumption of specific resources such as FLOPs or model size. When the regularizer loss is added to the training loss and their sum is minimized via stochastic gradient descent or a similar optimizer, the learning problem becomes a constrained optimization of the structure of the network, under the constraint represented by the regularizer. The method was first introduced in our CVPR 2018, paper "MorphNet: Fast & Simple Resource-Constrained Learning of Deep Network Structure".
- [kakaobrain/fast-autoaugment](https://github.com/kakaobrain/fast-autoaugment):  Official Implementation of 'Fast AutoAugment' in PyTorch.
- [naszilla/bananas](https://github.com/naszilla/bananas):    BANANAS is a neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm which uses Bayesian optimization with a meta neural network to predict the validation accuracy of neural architectures. We use a path-based encoding scheme to featurize the neural architectures that are used to train the neural network model. After training on just 200 architectures, we are able to predict the validation accuracy of new architectures to within one percent on average. The full NAS algorithm beats the state of the art on the NASBench and the DARTS search spaces. On the NASBench search space, BANANAS is over 100x more efficient than random search, and 3.8x more efficent than the next-best algorithm we tried. On the DARTS search space, BANANAS finds an architecture with a test error of 2.57%.
